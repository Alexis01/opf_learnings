# Ecosystem Learnings - OpenPOWER Foundation

Material from a recent session focused on ecosystem learnings from the OpenPOWER Foundation.

Created using [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md) as a front end for the  [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/#/) framework.

The basis of the presentation: [openpower_learnings.md](openpower_learnings.md)

The presentation in its full glory: [https://mandieq.github.io/opf_learnings/](https://mandieq.github.io/opf_learnings/)

Blog with my experiences of using this framework: _to be added_
