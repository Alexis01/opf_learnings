## What is the OpenPOWER Foundation?

<div style="font-size: 28px">

> The goal of the OpenPOWER Foundation is to create an <span id='bright'>open ecosystem</span>, using the POWER Architecture to share <span id='bright'>expertise</span>, <span id='bright'>investment</span>, and <span id='bright'>server-class intellectual property</span> to serve the evolving needs of <span id='bright'>customers and industry</span>.

</div>

<div style="font-size: 32px">

Speed to innovation | Standards | Choice

</div>

Notes: So what about the OpenPOWER Foundation? Here is the mission statement.

1. **Speed of innovation** – enabling radical innovation of products, markets and business models by quickly exploiting new technologies
2. **Integration** – is about open standards – creating building blocks which all fit together
3. **Choice** – competition drives prices to the right place, no vendor lock in.

<!-- .slide: data-background="images/opf_members.png" -->

<div id='dark_back'>

More than 350 members today

</div>

Notes: Which in practise means what?

An organisation today with more an 350 members and increasing.


----

<!-- .slide: data-background="images/opf_members.png" -->

<div id='dark_back'>

Ranging across many types of partner

![](images/process.png)

</div>

Notes: Those members range a huge amount in size and type.

But let's rewind a bit. Why did OpenPOWER come into being?

----

<!-- .slide: data-background="images/rocket.png" -->

<div id='dark_back' style="text-align: left;">

## Why OpenPOWER?

"Houston, we have a problem..."

</div>

Notes: Problem is:
- death of Moore's law: inability to squeeze more transistors into smaller space,
- not getting price / performance increase used to get with new processors
- at the same time needing more from the tech with technologies like AI  
  - getting real time insights from data / training neural networks.
- needing to take a holistic view, what are the pieces around the processor where we can find performance increases?

End users - are the ones needing that ever increasing performance while maintaining cost.

## In the beginning

<div id='bright'>

Founded in 2013

## OpenPOWER today

</div>

<!-- .slide: data-background-iframe="https://openpowerfoundation.org/" -->

Notes: Annual summits in the US, EU and China.

## Coming of age

<span id='bright'>Announced in August 2019:</span>

* Opening up of IBM POWER Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
* OpenCAPI and Open Memory Interface (OMI) reference designs released
* Move to Linux Foundation governance model

Notes: In August of this year OpenPOWER made some really big announcements.

### Getting things done

<div style="font-size: 25px">

> I need to get data between my processor and GPU super quickly!

> What about applications for my specific industry?

</div>

<span id='bright'>Working groups</span> to focus on specific areas

Plus:

<div style="font-size: 30px">
Board of Directors | Technical Steering Committee | Marketing Committee
</div>

<div style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); color: #fff; padding: 20px;">

## Think about the full stack

And all the pieces around the outside / at either end

</div>

Notes: Need a range of types of partners to get to the end goal.

- Researchers,
- people with a focus on the various building blocks which make the stack,
- people to bring the stack together and connecting those blocks,
- people to take stack to market,
- people to install and maintain the stack.

## WIIFM?

- End users? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- Revenue? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Partnerships with bigger companies? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- Access to building blocks? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
- Getting ahead of competition? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->

<span id='bright' style="font-size: 25px">What's in it for me?</span>

Notes: A really important question is "What's in it for me?". What do partners in the ecosystem care about? Can be hugely different for different partners.

----

## And when do I get it?

- Time spent vs time to rewards seen
- <span id='bright'>Smaller</span> organisations are time poor and need rewards now.
- <span id='bright'>Larger</span> organisations can afford to invest and wait.

## No favourite child

Working with competitors

### If you build it t(he)y will come.

<span id='bright'>Or will they?</span>

<br>

- Ambassadors program
- Developers program
- Recognise achievements
